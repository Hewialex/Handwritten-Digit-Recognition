# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview
This project is a Handwritten Digit Recognition application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, trained on the MNIST dataset, and deployed using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image of a handwritten digit in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format.
- **Digit Classification**: The application predicts the digit from the uploaded image and displays the result.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the app provides an intuitive user experience.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Streamlit
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-link]
   cd [your-project-folder]
